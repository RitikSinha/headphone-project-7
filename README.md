##### Things learned : flexbox and responsive design
The headphone Landing page is built with HTML and CSS. I learned a lot of things such as flexbox and responsive design. I read about flexbox and media query form documentation. It took 3.5 hrs to build this project.
The best part is that it is fully responsive. please check it out and give feedback.
